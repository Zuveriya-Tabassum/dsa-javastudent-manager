# Student Score Manager using DSA (Java)

This is a Java console application developed as part of the **SARVAGNA INNOVATION PRIVATE LIMITED - Week 1 DSA Task**. The application helps manage student records by storing their names and scores and provides operations to search, sort, and display information using core data structures and algorithms.

- **Array Traversal**: For displaying or searching through the list.
- **Linear Search**: To search a student by name.
